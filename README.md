## Australian Political Sentiment Analysis

This is my first project working with Scrapy, the python web scraper.<br>This project scrapes the Hansard from the Parliament of Australia's website. The Hansard is basically transcript of eveything said by politicians in parliament.
#### Project Goal
The goal of this project was to analyse the different topics that are spoken by both major political parties(Labour and Liberal). What topics were spoken by more favourably? How often were certain entities spoken about?
#### Methodology
The Hansard comes in PDF and XML form. I opted for XML, as pdf can be difficult to parse to plain text. The XML data was then parsed and cleaned into a NoSQL database.
